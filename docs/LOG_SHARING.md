# How to share logs "securely"?

Never **EVER** in your life should you publish your errors logs as an attachment to the GitHub issue,
paste them to any pastebin, or post them onto Discord, NEVER ever. They may (or may not) contain sensitive information,
like your account access token. However, if you __trust the developers of this mod__, you may share the logs
privately to them.

## For lazy people

Just DM or send a mail to any (or all) of the developers with your questions. Optionally (for Discord and Telegram),
apply the "spoiler" formatting to prevent any additional issues.

## For paranoids

If you're extremely afraid, you might encrypt your messages with developer's
[PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) public key. You might use software like
[GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) or any other at your choice to encrypt your message. The keys are
available for some developers in the "Contacts" section above. Do *NOT* encrypt message with
other developers' keys. (i.e. don't encrypt message for developer "A" with public key from developer "B")

## For extreme paranoids

Don't share your logs at all. (And maybe ask your programmer friend to help you)
