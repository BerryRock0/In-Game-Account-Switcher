# Stolen

Tips how to prevent and/or minimize possible abuse of your Microsoft account.
This applies only to accounts stored or managed by IAS, not third-party or official game launchers, mods, or other apps.
You can learn how to protect your account within IAS by looking at the [Crypt](CRYPT.md) page.

## Aftermath

If you think your account is ALREADY stolen from IAS, you SHOULD do this:

1. Immediately delete all your accounts from the IAS mod AND from any other launchers, apps and/or mods.
2. Close the game.
3. Go to [account.live.com/password/Change](https://account.live.com/password/Change) and change your Microsoft account password.
4. Go to [account.live.com/consent/manage](https://account.live.com/consent/manage) and revoke any apps/mods/launchers/etc. related to Minecraft (such as In-Game Account Switcher, MultiMC, Prism Launcher, Modrinth and/or any others) AND any apps that you don't recognize OR don't use.
5. Go to [account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional](https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional), scroll to the bottom and click "Sign out everywhere".
6. Optionally run (one or more) malware scanner (e.g. [KVRT](https://www.kaspersky.com/downloads/free-virus-removal-tool) from [Kaspersky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab), [CureIt](https://free.drweb.com/cureit/) by [Dr.Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr.Web), [Malwarebytes Free Scanner](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) by [Malwarebytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malwarebytes_(software)) or any other at your choice) or REINSTALL your system from the ground up if you think you have any problems. If you've done that, repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for redundancy. (as any malware may see your new password or add any apps back in)
7. Optionally enable two-factor authentication within your account, by going to [account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional](https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional), scrolling to the "Two-step verification" block and clicking "Turn on" below it.
8. Do not use the IAS mod for 31 days. (Or even better, do NOT use ANY Minecraft-related services for 31 days)

**Note**: If someone is currently playing on any server via your (stolen) account, you can try to use an official launcher to
login and connect to the server. This might not always work, but it may render their access tokens unusable.

## Preconditions

If you want to prevent your account from being stolen from IAS and/or minimize the damage from this, you may do this:

1. Use "Password Crypt" option with secure password that is different from any password you use. (even from one used for your Microsoft/Minecraft account)
2. Don't run suspicious apps (that may contain malware) on your PC and install antivirus software.
3. Revoke any apps that you don't recognize OR don't use at: [account.microsoft.com/consent/manage](https://account.live.com/consent/manage)
4. Enable two-factor authentication within your account, by going to [account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional](https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional), scrolling to the "Two-step verification" block and clicking "Turn on" below it.
5. Use secure password for your Microsoft/Minecraft account. You can change it at: [account.live.com/password/Change](https://account.live.com/password/Change)
6. Don't share your game folder with anyone. (or delete all your accounts from the IAS mod before sharing it)
7. Use common sense.
